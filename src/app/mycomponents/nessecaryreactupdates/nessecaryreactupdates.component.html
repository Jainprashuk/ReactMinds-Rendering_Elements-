<h1 class="text-center">React Only Updates Whatâ€™s Necessary</h1>
<br>
<p>React DOM compares the element and its children to the previous one, and only applies the DOM updates necessary to bring the DOM to the desired state.</p>
<p>You can verify by inspecting the last example with the browser tools</p>
<p>Even though we create an element describing the whole UI tree on every tick, only the text node whose contents have changed gets updated by React DOM.</p>
<p>In our experience, thinking about how the UI should look at any given moment, rather than how to change it over time, eliminates a whole class of bugs.</p>
